# Demo Rust on ESP32

This is a demo of Rust on ESP32. I have a tiny ESP32c6 board with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and one WS2812 RGB LED. This project
uses no_std. I chose this approach because I wanted to learn how to use Rust on a microcontroller. It opens another view
on the Rust ecosystem, because many crates are not available for no_std.

This project lightens the RGB LED in different colors.
